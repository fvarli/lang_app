# Privacy Policy (MVP)

LangRoutine is an offline-first language learning app.

## Data We Collect

- We do not collect personal data on a backend.
- We do not require account creation or login.
- We do not include ads.
- We do not include analytics or tracking SDKs in this MVP.

## Data Stored on Your Device

To support app functionality, LangRoutine stores limited local data on your device:

- selected level and daily goal
- progress such as completed lessons and streak
- app preferences (for example, theme)

This data is stored locally using on-device app storage and is not sent to a server.

## Data Deletion

You can clear local progress and preferences from the app Settings via "Reset progress".
